OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE: vscode-electron-build-tools

This project was significantly influenced by the open-source project vscode-electron-build-tools. Although no code was directly reused, key architectural ideas and design concepts from the project informed the development process. In particular, modified versions of its environment variable filtering logic—used to exclude variables such as ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE—were implemented to resolve runtime issues related to Electron process spawning within VS Code environments.
